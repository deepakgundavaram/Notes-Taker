# Unit 11 Express Note Taker
Note taker  application is designed to write, save, and delete notes, written to and retrieved from a backend JSON file

## Example Usage


## Approach
As the front end was already created, I needed to look at connecting this to the backend. 
1. Start a server using Express
2. Link the HTML to get and post requests in the backend JavaScript
3. Write the user's notes to the server's JSON file with unique IDs
4. The post method needs to write the note to the JSON file for retrieval
5. The get method needs to retrieve notes from the server for viewing
6. The delete method needs to locate and delete specific notes from the server
